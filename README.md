### Example Projects

* [Chris Richardson has published the example code for his QCONSF talk on building event-driven microservices. The example microservices-based application is built using event sourcing and command query responsibility separation (CQRS). There are currently two versions of the application - Scala/Spring and Java/Spring - with others to follow. Take a look!](https://github.com/cer/event-sourcing-examples)
